// Textual description
//
//Paint the given number of cells to create obstacles in the grid. Maximum one obstacle in each row and column is allowed. Place numbers from 1-7 in all the remaining cells in the grid so that the numbers do not repeat in any row and column. Then draw a closed loop that travels horizontally and vertically between the centers of adjacent cells and visits every cell not occpied by obstacle exactly once.
//The numbers along the loop must follow the worm rule of alternating higher and lower values. The numbers on the left show the sums of the numbers on the loop segments in the given row (in the correct order).
//The number of obstacles will be given next to each puzzle. 
//You only need to fill the numbers to score the points.
//
