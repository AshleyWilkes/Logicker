// Textual description
//
//Divide the grid into 21 different domino tiles. Numbers are represented by dots as in classic domino, so the orientation of the number representation has to be taken into account.
//
//
//  Example assignment
//
//Given domino halves in the grid; each half is given as 2 chars: number and orientation; here there are no numbers over 6, so orientation R (regular) means ??as the number is shown on a playing cube?? and I (irregular) means mirror image; for symmetrical numbers the orientation is always given as S.
//
//  2I 1S 1S 2I
//  2I 2I 2I 2R
//  2I 1S 2R 1S
//
//
//  Example solution
//
//Dominoes given as areas
//
//  1 2 2 3
//  1 4 4 3
//  5 5 6 6
