// Textual description
//
//Draw a laser beam in the grid that travels along the main diagonals of cells. The entrance and exit of the beam is marked. Horizontal and vertical mirrors can be placed on the intersections of the grid. If the beam hits a mirror it is reflected. The beam must meet each mirror just once. The numbers above and to the left of the grid identify how many cells the beam passes in that row/column. The numbers below and to the right identify how many mirrors are on the corresponding line. The beam must cross itself at places that are already marked (and can only cross at those points).
//The numbers between 1-5 have been replaced by letters. Same numbers by the same letters and different numbers by different letters.
