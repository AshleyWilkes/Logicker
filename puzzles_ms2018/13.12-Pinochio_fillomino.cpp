// Textual description
//
//Dissect the grid into areas and write a number in every cell. The numbers in one area have to be the same and have to tell the number of cells in that area. Areas of the same size may not touch horizontally or vertically, but may touch diagonally. Given numbers may belong to the same area, and it is possible that there are areas, where no number is given - even with larger numbers than the ones shown.
//The numbers are grouped into triples of the same value. Exactly one of the numbers in each triple is wrong.
