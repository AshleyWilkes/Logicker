// Textual description
//
//Draw a single continuous loop by connecting neighboring dots along the dotted lines or cell diagonals. The loop may not touch or cross itself, and it does not need to touch all of the dots.
//The numbers indicate how many edges of a cell are used for the loop. In each row and column there is exactly one number that breaks this rule. In such cell the loop has to go diagonally. The loop cannot travel diagonally in aby other cell.
