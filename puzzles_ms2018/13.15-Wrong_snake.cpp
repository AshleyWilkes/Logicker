//Draw a snake in the grid. The snake goes from cell to cell vertically or horizontally, but not diagonally. The snake does not touch itself, not even diagonally. The numbers outside the grid indicate how many squares are used by the snake in that row or column.
//The hints around the grid are all wrong however and are either one more or one less than the correct hints. Head and tail of the snake are already given.
